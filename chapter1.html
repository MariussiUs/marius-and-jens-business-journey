    <h3>12.10.2024</h3><h1>Chapter 1 <br>Learning code</h1><br><br>
    <h2>I learned it's good to start a business with a skillset,
        so i looked for one that could be usefull to know.
        Then i found it, website development. 
        I've coded before, but only on Roblox (i'm not very proud of that).
        So i've taken some time into learning to script javascript, html
        and css. <br><br>
        I'm three or four days into learning code and everyting is going good
        (if i didn't know how to code then how would i have made this website).
        <br>
        I can do functions, varibles (mostly backend stuff). <br> Website developing is fun
        though, so that will keep me motivated.
        <br><br>
        By the way today is my birthday, so i'm 13 years old today(12 october 2024)
